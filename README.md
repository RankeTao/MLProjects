My practices on Machine Learning Projects

## My first ML project - stock clustring
The project contain the below contents.
1. Load the stock prices from a csv file or load data from the web and plot the candle curve.
2. Scrape the website to get the stock symbol and dump the symbols data to json file.
3. Load the stock prices data and save to a csv file, then clustering the data using [Affinity Propagation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.cluster.AffinityPropagation.html) algorithm.
